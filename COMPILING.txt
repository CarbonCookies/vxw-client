If you haven't already installed DMD, you can download the latest version here:
https://dlang.org/download.html

You need at least one renderer module.
Probably the most reliable one is the Voxlap module, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/LeComm/aofclient-voxlap-renderer

On Linux:
1. If you are using Debian or Ubuntu and don't have these installed already:
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libenet-dev
sudo apt-get install git
If not, install SDL2, ENet and git the way you would do it on your distribution.
2. Open a terminal in this directory and write
./configure
to download derelict files
./compile-derelict
to compile the derelict files into a compact .a file
./compile
to compile the source

On Windows (untested):
1. Put SDL2.dll and ENet.dll into the .exe directory
2. Download the contents of:
https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2
https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictENet
https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictUtil
3. Create a directory called "derelict" here.
4. Paste the contents of the derelict directories from the repositories from 2.
(sdl2, enet, util)
5. Your renderer module's ./compile file should only contain a compiler command, so try to pasting that one into your command line
