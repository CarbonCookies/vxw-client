On Linux:

Create a directory called "derelict"
From here,
https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2/tree/master/source/derelict/
copy the directory "sdl2" into "./derelict" (so the .d files are in /derelict/sdl2)
Do the same here
https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictENet/tree/master/source/derelict/
with the directory "enet"

Then, if you haven't installed SDL2 and/or ENet yet,
(on Debian-based distributions)
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libenet-dev

./compile-derelict
to compile the derelict files into a compact .a file
./compile
to compile the source

On windows:
Exactly the same, but put sdl2.dll and enet.dll into the .exe directory instead of installing them via apt-get
